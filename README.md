## Lab 6 Deadline Requirements

Paragraph Description:

Our project is going to be on the React.js web framework. React is a fast-running, front-end web framework that automatically updates smaller components of a client’s frontend using a “virtual DOM”. The reason React is more fast paced than say Vanilla javascript is because the virtual DOM is a tree-like structure with different variable dependencies. When one thing on the frontend changes using vanilla javascript, the entire webpage must entirely reload. However, in React with the virtual DOM, dependencies are mapped so that only affected components will re-render when things are changed. 


React.js is a javascript framework, so primarily relies on the Javascript language. It also uses something called JSX which is a syntax extension of javascript that allows the user to not only handle javascript core logic but also handle frontend UI changes as you might do in a html file. React is analogous to the concepts we’ve learned in PPL thus far because it uses core concepts like functions are values, callbacks, higher-order functions, and abstract data types. 


Our project will serve as an introduction to the React.js framework from both a broad overview perspective and a shallow dive into understanding the core concepts of learning how to program using the React framework. We will discuss what React is, why it exists, the basic programming paradigm of React (classes, components, functions, rendering, props, state, and JSX), and finally we will touch on some more advanced React concepts that make the framework so powerful. 


2. A draft of materials we've gathered so far:
- https://reactjs.org/
- https://blog.hubspot.com/website/react-js


3. A draft of the script:


The basic plan of our script will be as follows:
- Introduction to React
	- When it was created
	- By whom
	- evolution of react overtime and widespread usage in fortune 500 companies
- Why does React exist
	- Speed, heavily integrated with already prominent javascript, etc
	- Virtual DOM
- Programming paradigm of React
- Classes/Components
- Functional React
- Render vs. return
	- JSX
- Props
- State
- Component inheritance / state inheritance and effects
- Asynchronous / Setting up React with a full-stack web app
